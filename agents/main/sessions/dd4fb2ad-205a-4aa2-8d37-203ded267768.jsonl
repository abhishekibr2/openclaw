My advice for everyone is NO DATING in highschool. Only do it if you can appropriately balance your academics with it. I promise you your education is so much more important. I got really lucky I got to make an excuse for extenuating circumstance in freshman year but I wouldn't recommend doing the same. I also think my low GPA was made up because of my schools reputation as private boarding school which often appears in the tops rankings for Niche boarding schools. I think my ECs were very well balanced but I would suggest that you concentrate in more of a certain theme. So I kind of regret that aspect of my application but thankfully it worked out! As for my internships the reason why I had so much was because I applied A LOT and I did some school year ones which helped amp up the resume. I think for Harvard it was a real shock for me to get in because my stats were terrible and ecs/awards were mid for the school. Anyways I'm really happy!

Not for homework, but to write down things I didn’t know how to say out loud.

To protect us, my father asked that we never leave the house together. This all began after he made a report against a corrupt businessman involved in illegal activities. Suddenly, even a short walk to the store felt like a strategic operation. The confinement shocked me as I had grown up independent, living in boarding school from third to sixth grade, before COVID.

My advice for everyone is NO DATING in highschool. Only do it if you can appropriately balance your academics with it. I promise you your education is so much more important. I got really lucky I got to make an excuse for extenuating circumstance in freshman year but I wouldn't recommend doing the same. I also think my low GPA was made up because of my schools reputation as private boarding school which often appears in the tops rankings for Niche boarding schools. I think my ECs were very well balanced but I would suggest that you concentrate in more of a certain theme. So I kind of regret that aspect of my application but thankfully it worked out! As for my internships the reason why I had so much was because I applied A LOT and I did some school year ones which helped amp up the resume. I think for Harvard it was a real shock for me to get in because my stats were terrible and ecs/awards were mid for the school. Anyways I'm really happy!

Not for homework, but to write down things I didn’t know how to say out loud.

To protect us, my father asked that we never leave the house together. This all began after he made a report against a corrupt businessman involved in illegal activities. Suddenly, even a short walk to the store felt like a strategic operation. The confinement shocked me as I had grown up independent, living in boarding school from third to sixth grade, before COVID.

My advice for everyone is NO DATING in highschool. Only do it if you can appropriately balance your academics with it. I promise you your education is so much more important. I got really lucky I got to make an excuse for extenuating circumstance in freshman year but I wouldn't recommend doing the same. I also think my low GPA was made up because of my schools reputation as private boarding school which often appears in the tops rankings for Niche boarding schools. I think my ECs were very well balanced but I would suggest that you concentrate in more of a certain theme. So I kind of regret that aspect of my application but thankfully it worked out! As for my internships the reason why I had so much was because I applied A LOT and I did some school year ones which helped amp up the resume. I think for Harvard it was a real shock for me to get in because my stats were terrible and ecs/awards were mid for the school. Anyways I'm really happy!

My advice for everyone is NO DATING in highschool. Only do it if you can appropriately balance your academics with it. I promise you your education is so much more important. I got really lucky I got to make an excuse for extenuating circumstance in freshman year but I wouldn't recommend doing the same. I also think my low GPA was made up because of my schools reputation as private boarding school which often appears in the tops rankings for Niche boarding schools. I think my ECs were very well balanced but I would suggest that you concentrate in more of a certain theme. So I kind of regret that aspect of my application but thankfully it worked out! As for my internships the reason why I had so much was because I applied A LOT and I did some school year ones which helped amp up the resume. I think for Harvard it was a real shock for me to get in because my stats were terrible and ecs/awards were mid for the school. Anyways I'm really happy!

Not for homework, but to write down things I didn’t know how to say out loud. The silence inside my home grew so heavy that a car idling too long in the lane sounded like thunder, and if footsteps paused outside, we stopped breathing inside, counting seconds, measuring danger in heartbeats. To protect us, my father asked that we never leave the house together. This all began after he made a report against a corrupt businessman involved in illegal activities. Suddenly, even a short walk to the store felt like a strategic operation. The confinement shocked me as I had grown up independent, living in boarding school from third to sixth grade, before COVID. Freedom had been my normal, but fear?
