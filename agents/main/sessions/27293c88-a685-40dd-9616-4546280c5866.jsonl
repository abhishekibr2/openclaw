DO NOT move to the next subreddit until explicitly instructed. CURRENT SUBREDDIT TO PROCESS: r/technology IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR RULES: - You MUST return at least ONE qualifying post if ANY reasonable match exists. - Do NOT return an empty result unless the subreddit truly has ZERO help-seeking posts. - If strict filters fail, relax them gradually as described below. WORKFLOW (STRICT SEQUENCE): Step 1: Open r/Entrepreneur - Sort posts by “New” Step 2: Identify help-seeking posts (PRIMARY FILTERS) Select posts that: - Contain a clear question or problem - Include a question mark (?) - Are advice-seeking or problem-solving in nature Preferred phrases (NOT mandatory): - “How do I” - “Need help” - “What’s the best way” - “Any advice” - “Can someone explain” Step 3: Competition Filter (FLEXIBLE) - Prefer posts with 0–3 comments - If none exist, allow up to 5 comments - If still none exist, return the LOWEST comment count help-seeking post available Step 4: Fallback Logic (CRITICAL) If no post matches ALL criteria: - Ignore keyword phrase requirement - Keep intent-based matching (user asking for help) - Still return the BEST possible match from “New” Step 5: Output EXACTLY what is found for THIS subreddit ONLY Return: - Subreddit name - Post title - One-line summary of the problem - Comment count - Direct link to the post Step 6: STOP COMPLETELY - Do NOT process any other subreddit - Wait for explicit approval or next-step instruction OUTPUT RULES: - Do NOT say “No posts found” unless absolutely zero advice-seeking posts exist - Do NOT include explanations of your reasoning - Output only the selected post(s) GOAL: Always surface actionable, low-competition help-seeking posts so follow-up tasks can be performed before moving on.\n[message_id: 5971e70f-2829-48fc-8ba2-eb00723c4871]"}],"timestamp":1770201282801}}
