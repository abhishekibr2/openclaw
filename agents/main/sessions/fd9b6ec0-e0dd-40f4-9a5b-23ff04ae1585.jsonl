I’m a 19 year old newbie running a mobile detailing business. I have a demand constraint due to me being unable to close enough people. I run meta ads so I get many price checkers and tire kickers, I’m afraid to add too much friction trying to qualify leads and run up the cost per lead disproportionate to my previous cost per acquisition.\n                                          - paragraph: My issue is that throughout the day I find myself having to text people back and forth selling the service and providing people with a ton of info. I also get burnt out because I have to close so many jobs constantly to make sure I have work since my services are lower ticket. My ads are profitable but I can only make so many sales when I’m busy throughout the day especially while working. My idea is to eventually hire someone to work the physical labor while I make sales. But can’t reasonably pay someone nor am I at a stage to do so.

I’m a 19 year old newbie running a mobile detailing business. I have a demand constraint due to me being unable to close enough people. I run meta ads so I get many price checkers and tire kickers, I’m afraid to add too much friction trying to qualify leads and run up the cost per lead disproportionate to my previous cost per acquisition.\n                                          - paragraph: My issue is that throughout the day I find myself having to text people back and forth selling the service and providing people with a ton of info. I also get burnt out because I have to close so many jobs constantly to make sure I have work since my services are lower ticket. My ads are profitable but I can only make so many sales when I’m busy throughout the day especially while working. My idea is to eventually hire someone to work the physical labor while I make sales. But can’t reasonably pay someone nor am I at a stage to do so.
