{"type":"message","id":"aac2fd5f","parentId":"a3a90287","timestamp":"2026-02-11T23:16:27.306Z","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Research Summary: OpenClaw\n\nOpenClaw is an open-source personal AI assistant designed to \"actually do things.\" It acts as a digital teammate capable of managing emails, calendars, and complex workflows directly through common messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.\n\n### 1. Key Features & Benefits (Why it's popular)\nOpenClaw has gained significant traction due to its focus on autonomy, local control, and extensibility:\n*   **True Autonomy:** Unlike chatbots that just talk, OpenClaw has \"eyes and hands\" on its environment. It can control a browser, execute shell commands, manage files, and resolve errors autonomously (e.g., resolving Sentry errors by opening PRs).\n*   **\"Local-First\" Gateway:** Your context, memory, and skills live on your own computer rather than in a third-party cloud. This provides superior privacy and allows the assistant to access local tools and files.\n*   **Multi-Channel Integration:** It meets you where you are. You can control your assistant through Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, iMessage (via BlueBubbles), or a web chat interface.\n*   **Infinite Extensibility (Skills):** Users can build custom \"Skills\" in TypeScript or even have the assistant build its own skills. It supports a wide range of providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) and features proactive \"heartbeats\" where it can check in or run cron jobs independently.\n*   **Cross-Device Nodes:** It can control paired \"nodes\" like iPhones, Android devices, or other Macs to perform location checks, take photos, or interact with mobile UIs.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions for macOS\nThe recommended setup for macOS users is through the interactive installer script.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n*   **Homebrew:** Recommended (the installer will attempt to install it if missing).\n*   **AI API Key:** You will need an API key from a provider like **Anthropic** (Claude) or **OpenAI**.\n\n#### Installation Steps\n1.  **Open Terminal:** Launch the Terminal app on your Mac.\n2.  **Run the Installer:** Execute the following one-line command to download and run the official install script:\n    ```bash\n    curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash\n    ```\n3.  **Follow the Wizard:**\n    *   The script will check for **Node.js 22** and **Git**, installing them via Homebrew if necessary.\n    *   It will download OpenClaw and place it in your path.\n    *   An **Onboarding Wizard** will launch automatically.\n4.  **Configure Your Provider:** During onboarding, provide your AI API key when prompted. This allows OpenClaw to \"think\" and process your requests.\n5.  **Connect a Channel:** Follow the instructions in the wizard to connect OpenClaw to your preferred messaging app (e.g., scan a QR code for WhatsApp or provide a bot token for Telegram).\n6.  **Verify Setup:** Once complete, run the following command to ensure everything is configured correctly:\n    ```bash\n    openclaw doctor\n    ```\n7.  **Start the Gateway:** Start the OpenClaw service by running:\n    ```bash\n    openclaw gateway start\n    ```\n    *Note: A macOS Menu Bar companion is also available as part of the installation for easier monitoring and control.*\n\n**Done!** You can now message your personal assistant on the channel you configured."}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"google/gemini-3-flash-preview","usage":{"input":27061,"output":760,"cacheRead":130878,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":158699,"cost":{"input":0.013530499999999999,"output":0.00228,"cacheRead":0.0065439,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.022354399999999996}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770851781117}}
