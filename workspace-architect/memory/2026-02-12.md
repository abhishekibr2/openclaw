### Skill Creation: Reddit Automation Bundle at 13:40

**Reason**: User requested automation for Reddit comments including discovery, generation, and reporting.

**Changes Made**:
- Created `/home/ibr-ai-agent/.openclaw/workspace-supervisour/reddit-manager/SKILL.md` (Orchestration)
- Created `/home/ibr-ai-agent/.openclaw/workspace-executor/reddit-bot/SKILL.md` (Browser Actions)
- Created `/home/ibr-ai-agent/.openclaw/workspace-reporter/reddit-stats/SKILL.md` (Tracking & Reporting)
- Updated `AGENTS.md` registry with new skills.

**Expected Impact**: specialized agents can now collaborate to automate Reddit engagement while maintaining specific constraints on post age, comment count, and tone.

**Verification**: Files written to respective workspaces; registry updated.
