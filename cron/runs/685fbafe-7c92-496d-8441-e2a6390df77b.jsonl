The cron system that was initially tried to access seems to be having connectivity issues.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Create a new TASKS.md file to track pending tasks?\n2. Look for tasks in another location?\n3. Help you set up a proper task tracking system?","runAtMs":1770455276806,"durationMs":45533,"nextRunAtMs":1770563322339}

It seems that while some tasks were initiated (particularly around Reddit interaction), there isn't a current list of pending tasks that I can access.\n\nWould you like me to create a task management file for you, or is there a specific system you use for tracking tasks that I might have missed?","runAtMs":1770459169618,"durationMs":33966,"nextRunAtMs":1770567203584}
