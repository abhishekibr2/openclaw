However, I noticed you're interested in productivity and focus techniques based on our previous conversation. Here's a practical tip that often helps entrepreneurs struggling with deep work: try the \"maker's schedule\" approach where you block 2-3 hour chunks specifically for your most important creative work, and guard these time slots fiercely from meetings and distractions. This works because creative tasks require sustained concentration that gets easily disrupted by context switching. The key is treating your creative time like non-negotiable appointments with yourself.
