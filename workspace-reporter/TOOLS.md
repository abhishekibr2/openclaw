# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Local notes and conventions that help you use your tools effectively. This file does **not** control which tools exist — it just documents how to use them in this workspace.

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever else helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
