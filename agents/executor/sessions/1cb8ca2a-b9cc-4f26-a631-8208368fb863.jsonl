Reddit Presence\nDirect mentions of IBR Infotech on Reddit are primarily **self-promotional** rather than independent user reviews.\n*   **Active Accounts:** There are dedicated accounts like `u/ibrinfotechusa` and `u/samibrinfotech` that post articles and marketing content.\n*   **Content Focus:** Their posts highlight expertise in:\n    *   **MERN and MEAN Stack Development**\n    *   **Laravel Application Development** (PHP framework)\n    *   **Inventory Management Software**\n    *   **Restaurant App Development** (features like POS integration and online ordering)\n    *   **Full-Stack Web Development**\n*   **Community Engagement:** There is very little organic discussion (comments or reviews) from other Reddit users on these posts. They appear to be used as a distribution channel for their blog content.\n\n### 2. Company Profile & Services\nIBR Infotech LLP is an active IT services firm based in **Indore, India** (LLPIN: ABA-3755). They position themselves as a full-service development studio offering:\n*   **Custom Software Development:** Specializing in web and mobile applications.\n*   **Hire-a-Developer Model:** They market the ability to \"hire dedicated developers\" for specific technologies like WordPress, PHP, and JavaScript frameworks.\n*   **Niche Solutions:** Specifically mentioned are restaurant management systems and automated inventory tools.\n\n### 3. Reputation and Independent Reviews\n*   **Reddit Reviews:** No independent \"client experience\" threads or negative reports (scams/complaints) were found on Reddit using multiple search queries.\n*   **General Web Presence:** The company maintains an active status in Indian corporate records. Their marketing emphasizes \"excellent customer support\" and \"reasonable\" pricing, though these claims originate from their own promotional material.\n\n### Summary\nIBR Infotech appears to be a legitimate IT services provider focused on web development and specialized business software. On Reddit, their presence is limited to self-posted informational guides and service advertisements. There are no notable public discussions or third-party reviews on the platform either praising or criticizing their work.","textSignature":"CiEBjz1rX87YhfPT1Awr8kXTsLgAi26Op6rjJr9zEAd0uLEKIQGPPWtfp/S7XUx+VwoXVHoTwNSMb/IbXKIS9tt4+/fgrw=="}],"api":"google-gemini-cli","provider":"google-gemini-cli","model":"gemini-3-flash-preview","usage":{"input":11174,"output":493,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":11667,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770900053745}}
