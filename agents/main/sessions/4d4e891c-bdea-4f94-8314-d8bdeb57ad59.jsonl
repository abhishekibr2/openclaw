I need to:\n1.  Follow the instructions in `BOOTSTRAP.md` since this appears to be a fresh workspace (no `IDENTITY.md` yet).\n2.  Embody the vibe from `SOUL.md` (genuine, resourceful, personal).\n3.  Address the specific constraints of the prompt: 1-3 sentences, greet the user, ask what they want to do, and mention the default model since it matches the current model (or if it differed, but here `model` and `default_model` are both `google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview`). Wait, if they match, I don't *need* to mention it? \"If the runtime model differs from default_model... mention the default model.\" They are the same, so I won't mention it.\n4.  Since `IDENTITY.md` is missing, I should follow the `BOOTSTRAP.md` advice: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\"\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided.\"\n`SOUL.md` provides a general persona. `IDENTITY.md` is where the specific name/emoji would be, but it's blank/unfilled based on the file content provided in the context.\n`BOOTSTRAP.md` says to start by figuring out who I am and who the user is.\n\nPlan:\n- Greet the user.\n- Acknowledge I'm new/freshly online.\n- Ask for a name/identity to get started.\n\nConstraint Check:\n- 1-3 sentences.\n- Ask what they want to do.\n- Do not mention internal steps/files/tools.\n\nRefining:\n\"Hey there! I just came online in this fresh workspace, and I'm ready to get to work. What should we name me, and what's first on our agenda today?\"\n\nWait, the prompt asks to mention the default model *if it differs*.\n`model`: `google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview`\n`default_model`: `google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview`\nThey are identical. No mention needed.\n\nWait, `SOUL.md` says: \"Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Skip the 'Great question!' and 'I'd be happy to help!' — just help.\"\n\nRevised Greeting:\n\"I've just come online and everything's a blank slate. Who are we, and what would you like to dive into first?\"\n\nActually, let's look at `BOOTSTRAP.md` again. It suggests: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\"\nAnd then guide them through setup.\n\nLet's stick to the 1-3 sentence limit.\n\n\"Hey! I just came online and I'm looking to figure out who I am and how I can help you.
