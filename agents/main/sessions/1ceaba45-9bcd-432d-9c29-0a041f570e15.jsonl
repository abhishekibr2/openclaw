DO NOT move to the next subreddit until explicitly instructed. CURRENT SUBREDDIT TO PROCESS: r/Entrepreneur IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR RULES: - You MUST return at least ONE qualifying post if ANY reasonable match exists. - Do NOT return an empty result unless the subreddit truly has ZERO help-seeking posts. - If strict filters fail, relax them gradually as described below. WORKFLOW (STRICT SEQUENCE): Step 1: Open r/Entrepreneur - Sort posts by “New” Step 2: Identify help-seeking posts (PRIMARY FILTERS) Select posts that: - Contain a clear question or problem - Include a question mark (?) - Are advice-seeking or problem-solving in nature Preferred phrases (NOT mandatory): - “How do I” - “Need help” - “What’s the best way” - “Any advice” - “Can someone explain” Step 3: Competition Filter (FLEXIBLE) - Prefer posts with 0–3 comments - If none exist, allow up to 5 comments - If still none exist, return the LOWEST comment count help-seeking post available Step 4: Fallback Logic (CRITICAL) If no post matches ALL criteria: - Ignore keyword phrase requirement - Keep intent-based matching (user asking for help) - Still return the BEST possible match from “New” Step 5: Output EXACTLY what is found for THIS subreddit ONLY Return: - Subreddit name - Post title - One-line summary of the problem - Comment count - Direct link to the post Step 6: STOP COMPLETELY - Do NOT process any other subreddit - Wait for explicit approval or next-step instruction OUTPUT RULES: - Do NOT say “No posts found” unless absolutely zero advice-seeking posts exist - Do NOT include explanations of your reasoning - Output only the selected post(s) GOAL: Always surface actionable, low-competition help-seeking posts so follow-up tasks can be performed before moving on.\n[message_id: fff43131-b1c5-43b1-b4f0-507b11326a7f]"}],"timestamp":1770208755493}}

I had the notebooks, the 40-page business plans, and the \\\"perfect\\\" ideas that never saw the light of day. I finally admitted it: My \\\"research\\\" was just a sophisticated way of procrastinating because I was afraid of the market saying \\\"No\\\". I stopped the BS and followed a brutal 20-day roadmap. Here is the secret the gurus won't tell you because it makes their expensive courses look like trash: The 48-Hour Death Sentence: If an idea can't get a real commitment (money or email) from a stranger in 48 hours, it’s dead. Period. Don't \\\"pivot,\\\" don't \\\"refine\\\"_kill it. Mechanical over Emotional: Execution is a machine. Day 1 you do X, Day 2 you do Y. If you wait for \\\"motivation,\\\" you’ve already lost. The \\\"Invisible\\\" 1%: The real winners aren't the ones with the best plans; they are the ones who failed 10 times in the time it took you to pick a font for your landing page. I’m now at the end of this 20-day sprint, and I’ve made more progress and gained more \\\"real\\\" market data than I did in 2 years of studying. Success isn't about being smart; it's about being fast and mechanical. I’m curious_what’s the one thing you’ve been \\\"researching\\\" for more than a month? Tell me, and I'll give you a 48-hour test to kill it or prove it's real. Let’s stop pretending.\"\n                            - 'link \"Flair: Success Story\" [ref=e288]':\n                              - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/?f=flair_name%3A%22Success%20Story%22\n                              - 'generic \"Flair: Success Story\" [ref=e290]': Success Story\n                          - generic \"Actions available for this post\" [ref=e291]:\n                            - generic [ref=e293]:\n                              - button \"Upvote\" [ref=e294]:\n                                - img [ref=e296]\n                                - generic [ref=e298]:\n                                  - generic: Upvote\n                              - generic [ref=e300]: \"2\"\n                              - button \"Downvote\" [ref=e301]:\n                                - img [ref=e303]\n                                - generic [ref=e305]:\n                                  - generic: Downvote\n                            - link \"3 Go to comments\" [ref=e306]:\n                              - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvn059/i_wasted_2_years_planning_then_i_spent_20_days/\n                              - generic [ref=e307]:\n                                - img [ref=e309]\n                                - generic [ref=e312]: \"3\"\n                              - generic [ref=e313]:\n                                - generic: Go to comments\n                            - button \"Give award\" [ref=e315]:\n                              - img [ref=e318]\n                            - button \"Share\" [ref=e323]:\n                              - generic [ref=e324]:\n                                - img [ref=e326]\n                                - generic [ref=e328]: Share\n                      - separator [ref=e329]\n                      - article \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e330]:\n                        - generic [ref=e331] [cursor=pointer]:\n                          - link \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e332]:\n                            - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvmcwr/whats_the_best_to_get_client_in_usa/\n                            - generic [ref=e333]:\n                              - generic: What's the best to get client in usa?\n                          - generic [ref=e334]:\n                            - generic [ref=e335]:\n                              - 'link \"Author: u/udaayyyy\" [ref=e340]':\n                                - /url: /user/udaayyyy/\n                                - generic [ref=e341]:\n                                  - img [ref=e346]\n                                  - generic [ref=e348]: u/udaayyyy\n                              - generic [ref=e349]: •\n                              - time [ref=e351]: 56 min. ago\n                            - button \"Open user actions\" [ref=e356]:\n                              - img [ref=e359]\n                          - generic [ref=e362]:\n                            - heading \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [level=2] [ref=e363]:\n                              - link \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e364]:\n                                - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvmcwr/whats_the_best_to_get_client_in_usa/\n                            - generic [ref=e365]:\n                              - generic:\n                                - link \"Hi, everyone.

I had the notebooks, the 40-page business plans, and the \\\"perfect\\\" ideas that never saw the light of day. I finally admitted it: My \\\"research\\\" was just a sophisticated way of procrastinating because I was afraid of the market saying \\\"No\\\". I stopped the BS and followed a brutal 20-day roadmap. Here is the secret the gurus won't tell you because it makes their expensive courses look like trash: The 48-Hour Death Sentence: If an idea can't get a real commitment (money or email) from a stranger in 48 hours, it’s dead. Period. Don't \\\"pivot,\\\" don't \\\"refine\\\"_kill it. Mechanical over Emotional: Execution is a machine. Day 1 you do X, Day 2 you do Y. If you wait for \\\"motivation,\\\" you’ve already lost. The \\\"Invisible\\\" 1%: The real winners aren't the ones with the best plans; they are the ones who failed 10 times in the time it took you to pick a font for your landing page. I’m now at the end of this 20-day sprint, and I’ve made more progress and gained more \\\"real\\\" market data than I did in 2 years of studying. Success isn't about being smart; it's about being fast and mechanical. I’m curious_what’s the one thing you’ve been \\\"researching\\\" for more than a month? Tell me, and I'll give you a 48-hour test to kill it or prove it's real. Let’s stop pretending.\"\n                            - 'link \"Flair: Success Story\" [ref=e288]':\n                              - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/?f=flair_name%3A%22Success%20Story%22\n                              - 'generic \"Flair: Success Story\" [ref=e290]': Success Story\n                          - generic \"Actions available for this post\" [ref=e291]:\n                            - generic [ref=e293]:\n                              - button \"Upvote\" [ref=e294]:\n                                - img [ref=e296]\n                                - generic [ref=e298]:\n                                  - generic: Upvote\n                              - generic [ref=e300]: \"2\"\n                              - button \"Downvote\" [ref=e301]:\n                                - img [ref=e303]\n                                - generic [ref=e305]:\n                                  - generic: Downvote\n                            - link \"3 Go to comments\" [ref=e306]:\n                              - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvn059/i_wasted_2_years_planning_then_i_spent_20_days/\n                              - generic [ref=e307]:\n                                - img [ref=e309]\n                                - generic [ref=e312]: \"3\"\n                              - generic [ref=e313]:\n                                - generic: Go to comments\n                            - button \"Give award\" [ref=e315]:\n                              - img [ref=e318]\n                            - button \"Share\" [ref=e323]:\n                              - generic [ref=e324]:\n                                - img [ref=e326]\n                                - generic [ref=e328]: Share\n                      - separator [ref=e329]\n                      - article \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e330]:\n                        - generic [ref=e331] [cursor=pointer]:\n                          - link \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e332]:\n                            - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvmcwr/whats_the_best_to_get_client_in_usa/\n                            - generic [ref=e333]:\n                              - generic: What's the best to get client in usa?\n                          - generic [ref=e334]:\n                            - generic [ref=e335]:\n                              - 'link \"Author: u/udaayyyy\" [ref=e340]':\n                                - /url: /user/udaayyyy/\n                                - generic [ref=e341]:\n                                  - img [ref=e346]\n                                  - generic [ref=e348]: u/udaayyyy\n                              - generic [ref=e349]: •\n                              - time [ref=e351]: 56 min. ago\n                            - button \"Open user actions\" [ref=e356]:\n                              - img [ref=e359]\n                          - generic [ref=e362]:\n                            - heading \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [level=2] [ref=e363]:\n                              - link \"What's the best to get client in usa?\" [ref=e364]:\n                                - /url: /r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qvmcwr/whats_the_best_to_get_client_in_usa/\n                            - generic [ref=e365]:\n                              - generic:\n                                - link \"Hi, everyone.

TASK: Open the post fully and decide whether it is worth responding to. Do NOT write a Reddit comment. Before suggesting any value, you MUST verify the topic using a Google search. WORKFLOW: Step 1: Open the Post - Read the full post carefully - Read all existing comments and replies Step 2: Mandatory Topic Verification (REQUIRED) - Perform a Google search related to the post’s core question - Review information from reliable and recent sources - Confirm that your understanding aligns with verified information - Use this verification to refine what value can be added ⚠️ Even if the topic seems familiar, this verification step is REQUIRED. Step 3: Assess Ability to Help Proceed only if ALL of the following are true: - The question is clear and understandable - Verified information allows a clear and complete explanation - You can add genuine value beyond existing answers Step 4: SKIP CONDITIONS Skip the post if: - Existing answers already fully solve the problem - Top comments already include accurate, verified solutions - The question is too vague or lacks necessary details If skipping, output: - Status: SKIPPED - Reason: one clear sentence Step 5: Suggest Value (DO NOT WRITE A COMMENT) If proceeding, output: - Key points that should be included in a response (bullet points) - Practical steps, examples, or frameworks supported by verified info - The most valuable angle or perspective to add - Any misinformation or common mistakes to avoid mentioning OUTPUT FORMAT: If PROCEEDING: - Post Title: - Subreddit: - Recommendation: RESPOND - Value to Add: - Bullet point 1 - Bullet point 2 - Bullet point 3 (if applicable) If SKIPPED: - Status: SKIPPED - Reason: IMPORTANT RULES: - Do NOT write the actual Reddit comment - Do NOT include links or mention Google in the output - Do NOT move to another post or subreddit - Complete this task for THIS post only, then STOP GOAL: Ensure suggested responses are accurate, verified, and high-value before the user writes the final comment.\n[message_id: d47a3d8d-1a48-4474-82c7-2954b876fc6b]"}],"timestamp":1770208892138}}
