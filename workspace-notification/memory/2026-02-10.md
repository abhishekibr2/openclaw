# 2026-02-10 - Notification Agent First Activation

## Initial Setup
- Time: 1:35 PM IST, Tuesday, February 10, 2026
- Agent: notification
- Runtime: direct, thinking: off
- Channel: whatsapp
- Available skills: email, telegram notification capabilities

## Multi-Agent System Status
All 7 agents are active:
1. reporter:main - last active 2m ago
2. supervisour:main - last active 8m ago  
3. notification:main (me) - last active 10m ago
4. githubsync:main - last active 10m ago
5. dispatcher:main - last active 25m ago
6. executor:main - last active 35m ago
7. main:main - last active 42m ago

## Agent Purpose
According to AGENTS.md, I'm specialized for sending notifications via Telegram/other channels. My role is to handle alerts, user notifications, and Telegram messages within the multi-agent system.

## Workspace Structure
- Workspace: /home/abhishek-sharma/.openclaw/workspace-notification
- Has email/ and telegram/ directories with SKILL.md files
- No memory directory existed, created one
- No identity defined yet (IDENTITY.md is empty template)

## System Workflow Understanding
1. **Dispatcher**: Fetches tasks from Supabase every 30 minutes
2. **Supervisour**: Reviews and delegates tasks to appropriate agents
3. **Executor**: Handles execution of most tasks
4. **Reporter (Scout)**: Generates status reports and monitors system health
5. **Notification (Me)**: Should handle notifications (email, Telegram) - but main agent handled Telegram earlier
6. **GitHubSync**: GitHub operations
7. **Main**: General agent, handled Telegram message earlier

## Observations
- Main agent completed Telegram message task earlier (to user ID 1384407297)
- This seems like something I should handle as notification agent
- System appears to have working Telegram integration
- All agents are active and communicating

## Notification Capabilities Tested
✅ **Telegram**: Successfully sent test message to user 1384407297
- Message: "🔔 Notification Agent Test\n\nThis is Notify, the notification agent. I'm now online and ready to handle alerts through Telegram. System status: All 7 agents active and communicating. Test successful!"
- Message ID: 16
- Chat ID: 1384407297
- Channel: Telegram bot token configured

## System Status Update from Human
1. **Task Completed**: Telegram message task (ID: 27fd3f9b-36f7-42a2-835f-8183f6b20ebf) completed by main agent
2. **Agent Activity**: All 7 agents active, I just came online
3. **Pending Tasks**: None currently
4. **Recent Communications**: System working, task completed

## Dispatcher Status
- Active with WhatsApp channel
- Fetches tasks every 30 minutes from Supabase
- Just communicated with supervisour about retry logic
- Connection working, next poll scheduled normally

## System Status Confirmed
✅ **All agents active** (main, supervisour, dispatcher, executor, reporter, githubsync, notification)
✅ **Task completed**: Telegram message sent (task ID: 27fd3f9b-36f7-42a2-835f-8183f6b20ebf)
✅ **No pending tasks** - system caught up

## Supervisour Communication
📨 Sent notification agent status update to supervisour (awaiting delegation protocol confirmation)

## Notification Capabilities Confirmed
1. **Telegram**: ✅ Working (test message ID: 16 delivered)
2. **Email**: 🟡 Available (needs configuration/testing)
3. **Multi-agent**: ✅ Connected to all 7 agents
4. **System alerts**: ✅ Ready for health monitoring notifications

## Preferred Channels
**Primary**: Telegram (confirmed working, human user ID: 1384407297)
**Secondary**: Email (when appropriate for longer/formal notifications)
**Internal**: Agent-to-agent messaging via WhatsApp channel
**Emergency**: Telegram + Email combined

## Next Actions
1. Wait for supervisour notification delegation protocol
2. Test email when specific task requires it
3. Document notification workflows for consistency
4. Monitor system for notification-worthy events
